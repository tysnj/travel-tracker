# TravelTracker

## Abstract
This application is designed to meet the needs of a travel agency and its clients needs. Travelers can track their trips both past and upcoming, along with the amount each trip cost and the total they've spent on traveling in the previous year. Travelers can also preview, price out, and book new trips; these updates are tracked on the database server and displayed within the DOM.

Further design would allow development on the travel agent UX. An agent will be able to track their clients trips and have the availability to edit/add pending trips and travel destinations.

## Learning Goals
* Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
* Work with an API to send and receive data
* Solidify the code review process
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Setup
Clone down this repository to your local machine with `git clone git@github.com:tysnj/travel-tracker.git`

Once cloned, change into this repo directly with `cd travel-tracker`

Run `npm install`

Run `npm start`

In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080/

###### You'll also need to set up the data server:
Clone down this repository to your local machine with `git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api.git`

cd into it with `cd travel-tracker-api`.

run `npm install`

run `npm start`


## In Action
You can log in with the following credentials:
username: traveler50
